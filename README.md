## Overview

A website using generative AI to help users find affordable furniture, dispose of unwanted furniture responsibly, and extend the lifespan of their existing furniture.

## Furniture Reformer: What is it?

The reason it is called "Furniture Reformer" because it aims to tackle two problems regarding how people perceive furniture:

1. Reforming Furniture: This interpretation emphasizes the project's focus on extending the lifespan of existing furniture, providing users with guides for repairs, refurbishing, and maintenance, essentially "reforming" their furniture to give it a second life.

2. Reforming the Furniture Industry: This interpretation takes a broader view, aiming to reform how people interact with furniture, promoting responsible disposal, encouraging reuse and affordability, and potentially creating a more sustainable furniture ecosystem.

## Why Furniture Reformer?

Our inspiration for "Furniture Reformer" stemmed from a confluence of factors. On a personal level, the environmental impact of improper furniture disposal troubled us. We envisioned a solution that diverted the furniture from landfills and promoted a more sustainable approach to furniture usage. Furthermore, within our community, we recognized a clear need for resources. People struggled to find affordable furniture options or lacked guidance on responsible disposal. "Furniture Reformer" emerged as a way to bridge this gap and empower users by connecting them with the resources they need. Finally, the project ignited our entrepreneurial spirit because "Furniture Reformer" allowed us to explore the potential of generative AI in tackling real-world problems. By integrating generative AI into the website, we created a platform that could not only connect users with information, but also utilize AI's capabilities to provide personalized recommedations and solutions.

## Our Solution

Our project, "Furniture Reformer," tackles the issue of improper furniture disposal and limited access to affordable furniture options within our community. It leverages generative AI to create a user-friendly website the empowers individuals to make informed decisions regarding their furniture.

Here is a breakdown of our solution's functionalities:

1. Finding Affordable Furniture:
   - User Input Flexibility: I added the inclusion of detailed user input options like category, price range, condition, and location. This allows for a highly personalized search experience.
   - Generative AI Integration: Working closely with the team, I integrated generative AI to create user-friendly responses. The website utilizes text generation and prompt engineering to desribe the local resources based on user selections, providing clear and concise information.
   - Interactive Interface: To further enhance user experience, I implemented a drop-down list with hyperlinks to resource websites and an interactive map pinpointing locations. This is one-stop-shop approach streamlines the process.

2. Responsible Disposal:
   - Dynamic Information Delivery: I worked within the team to ensure the website dynamically delivers appropriate information based on the user's disposal method selection (donate, sell, or dispose).
   - AI-powered Recommendations: For donation scenarios, generative AI again plays a role through text generation and prompt engineering describing the relevant resources and providing a drop-down list with links and an interactive map pinpointing locations.
   - Marketplace Guidance: For those wanting to sell, the website displays suggestions for suitable online marketplaces or classifieds through text generation and prompt engineering.
   - Disposal Services Integration: If disposal is chosen, I contributed to integrating a service directory featuring reputable junk removal services and recycling facilities, complete with phone numbers for scheduling pickups.

3. Extending Furniture Lifespan:
   - Image Recognition Integration: My focus here was on integrating computer vision. The website analyzes uploaded furniture images to determine its condition.
   - Personalized Maintenance Solutions: Working with the team, I ensured the website uses AI-powered text generation with prompt engineering to recommend maintenance guides, repair instructions, or dismantling guides based on the identified furniture condition. This personalized approach empowers users to extend their furniture's lifespan

"Furniture Reformer" aims to be a one-stop shop for all furniture-related needs. By promoting responsible disposal, encouraging furniture reuse, and extending furniture lifespans, the project contributes to a more sustainable approach to furniture consumption within the community. Additionally, it empowers users by providing them with the resources and knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their furniture.
