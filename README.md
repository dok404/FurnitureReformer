# Furniture Reformer

## Overview

A website using generative AI to help users find affordable furniture, dispose of unwanted items responsibly, and extend the lifespan of their existing furniture.

## Furniture Reformer: What is it?

The reason it is called "Furniture Reformer" because it aims to give two interpretations for the name:

1. Reforming Furniture: This interpretation emphasizes the project's focus on extending the lifespan of existing furniture. It suggests the website provides uses with resources for repairs, refurbishing, and maintenance, essentially "reforming" their furniture to give it a new lease on life (a second life, whichever sounds better).

2. Reforming the Furniture Industry: this interpretation takes a broader view. It suggests the project aims to reform how people interact with furniture, promoting responsible disposal, encouraging reuse and affordability, and potentially creating a more sustainable furniture ecosystem.

## Why Furniture Reformer?

My inspiration for "Furniture Reformer" stemmed from a confluence of factors. Environmental concerns about furniture waste played a role, pushing me to find a solution that diverted items from landfills and promote sustainability. Additionally, I recognized a need within my community for resources related to affordable furniture access and responsible disposal options. "Furniture Reformer" became a way to bridge this gap and empower users. Finally, the project tapped into my entreneurial spirit, allowing me to explore the potential of generative AI in tackling real-world problems and creating a practical and innovative solution.
