# Furniture Reformer

## Overview

A website using generative AI to help users find affordable furniture, dispose of unwanted items responsibly, and extend the lifespan of their existing furniture.

## Furniture Reformer: What is it?

The reason it is called "Furniture Reformer" because it aims to give two interpretations for the name:

1. Reforming Furniture: This interpretation emphasizes the project's focus on extending the lifespan of existing furniture. It suggests the website provides uses with resources for repairs, refurbishing, and maintenance, essentially "reforming" their furniture to give it a new lease on life (a second life, whichever sounds better).

2. Reforming the Furniture Industry: This interpretation takes a broader view. It suggests the project aims to reform how people interact with furniture, promoting responsible disposal, encouraging reuse and affordability, and potentially creating a more sustainable furniture ecosystem.

## Why Furniture Reformer?

Our inspiration for "Furniture Reformer" stemmed from a confluence of factors. On a personal level, the environmental impact of improper furniture disposal troubled us. We envisioned a solution that diverted the furniture from landfills and promoted a more sustainable approach to furniture usage. Furthermore, within our community, we recognized a clear need for resources. People struggled to find affordable furniture options or lacked guidance on responsible disposal. "Furniture Reformer" emerged as a way to bridge this gap and empower uses by connecting them with the resources they needed. Finally, the project ignited our entrepreneurial spirit. "Furniture Reformer" allowed us to explore the potential of generative AI in tackling real-world problems. By integrating generative AI into the website, we created a platform that could not only connect users with information, but also utilize AI's capabilities to provide personalized recommedations and solutions.

## Our Solution

Our project, "Furniture Reformer," tackles the issue of improper furniture disposal and limited access to affordable furniture options within our community. It leverages generative AI to create a user-friendly website the empowers individuals to make informed decisions regarding their furniture.

     - A text generation to describe the local resources where they can find furniture that they are looking for
     - A drop-down list with hyperlinks to each of the local resource's website
     - A map pinpointing where the local resources are
     - Affordable Furniture Acquisition: Users are directed to local resources where they can find similar furniture for free or at discounted prices
     - Responsible Disposal: The website connects users with donation centers, recycling facilities, or reputable junk removal services based on their location and furniture type
     - Selling Furniture: Users can be directed to online marketplaces or local classifieds sections suitable for selling their furniture

2. Responsible Disposal:
   - Users can select category, method, size, material, if pickup is required, and location
   - Based on the user's criteria, the website provides user with different information depending on disposal method:
     - If "Donate" is selected:
       - A text generation to describe the local resource where they can donate their furniture
       - A drop-down list with hyperlinks to each of the local resource's website
       - A map pinpointing where the local resources are
     - If "Sell" is selected:
       - A text generation to describe the online and local resources where the they can sell their furniture
     - If "Dispose" is selected:
       - Provide the URL and phone number of their city to schedule a pickup

     - DIY Repair Guides: Step-by-step instructions are offered for common furniture repairs
     - Refurbishing Inspiration: The website might showcase creative ways to refurbish furniture (using Dall-E?)

3. Extending Furniture Lifespan:
   - Users can upload a picture of their furniture
   - Based on computer vision used to analyze the furniture's condtion, the website use text generation to provide maintenance guides, repair guides, or dismantling guides
   - Throughout the user experience, generative AI plays a crucial role. It analyzes user input (furniture image), generates appropriate responses and recommendations, and personalizes the experience based on furniture type and condition
   - The website, powerered by generative AI and computer vision, analyzes the image to identify the furniture type and condition
   - Additionally, features like prompt engineering can be employed to tailor the information presented to the user. For instance, the website could adapt its language based on whether the user is looking to dispose of, sell, or restore their furniture
