## Overview

A website using generative AI to help users find affordable furniture, dispose of unwanted furniture responsibly, and extend the lifespan of their existing furniture.

## Furniture Reformer: What is it?

The reason it is called "Furniture Reformer" because it aims to tackle two problems regarding how people perceive furniture:

1. Reforming Furniture: This interpretation emphasizes the project's focus on extending the lifespan of existing furniture, providing users with guides for repairs, refurbishing, and maintenance, essentially "reforming" their furniture to give it a second life.

2. Reforming the Furniture Industry: This interpretation takes a broader view, aiming to reform how people interact with furniture, promoting responsible disposal, encouraging reuse and affordability, and potentially creating a more sustainable furniture ecosystem.

## Why Furniture Reformer?

Our inspiration for "Furniture Reformer" stemmed from a confluence of factors. On a personal level, the environmental impact of improper furniture disposal troubled us. We envisioned a solution that diverted the furniture from landfills and promoted a more sustainable approach to furniture usage. Furthermore, within our community, we recognized a clear need for resources. People struggled to find affordable furniture options or lacked guidance on responsible disposal. "Furniture Reformer" emerged as a way to bridge this gap and empower users by connecting them with the resources they need. Finally, the project ignited our entrepreneurial spirit because "Furniture Reformer" allowed us to explore the potential of generative AI in tackling real-world problems. By integrating generative AI into the website, we created a platform that could not only connect users with information, but also utilize AI's capabilities to provide personalized recommedations and solutions.
