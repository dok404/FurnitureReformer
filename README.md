# Furniture Reformer

## Overview

A website using generative AI to help users find affordable furniture, dispose of unwanted items responsibly, and extend the lifespan of their existing furniture.

## Furniture Reformer: What is it?

The reason it is called "Furniture Reformer" because it aims to give two interpretations for the name:

1. Reforming Furniture: This interpretation emphasizes the project's focus on extending the lifespan of existing furniture. It suggests the website provides uses with resources for repairs, refurbishing, and maintenance, essentially "reforming" their furniture to give it a new lease on life (a second life, whichever sounds better).

2. Reforming the Furniture Industry: this interpretation takes a broader view. It suggests the project aims to reform how people interact with furniture, promoting responsible disposal, encouraging reuse and affordability, and potentially creating a more sustainable furniture ecosystem.
